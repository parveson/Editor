Strategic Plan Assessment

This is a checklist of questions that can be addressed to any published strategic plan, to determine how effective it is likely to be; how well its accomplishments can be tracked, and how well it may serve as an employee communication tool.  

Is the plan strategic?

Does the plan describe strategies for achieving mission outcomes, or does it merely describe what the organization does (operational plans)?

Are all goals/objectives strategies?

Are outcomes/results defined?

Is there a detailed vision, or just a brief statement?

Does the plan claim to follow the BSC?  If so, how closely does it actually fit?

Are performance measures included?

Are targets included?
