<h3>Known Bugs and Modifications Needed<BR></h3>
<P></P>
<P><STRONG>    
   9/1/05:</STRONG></P>
<P>Modify: tblFileDis has only one DisID per file (disciplines).
<BR>There should be up to 5 disciplines that can be attributed to a file, just 
as for the reviewer disciplines. The author should do this in 
authors/addfile.asp.</P>

<p><strong>4/13/06:</strong></p>
<p>This bug report page needs to be made available to all testers to input their bug reports. 
</p>
<p>If an author is added but already exists (based on same email address), the page
notes this but then says that an email was sent anyway. Remove this -- for
editors and reviewers also.</p>

<p><strong>4/27/07:</strong></p>
<p>Need to convert addeditor.asp and addreviewer.asp from plain text to HTML formatted
    emails.  Use addauthor.asp as template.</p>

<p><strong>12/11/2018</strong></p>
<p>Add ''forgot password'' functionality for author, editor and reviewer logins.</p>
<p>The whole application needs to be placed within an encrypted website (SSL). </p>
